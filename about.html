        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <p>I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan with my girlfriend, two dogs, and a cat. I grew up in Los Altos, California.</p>

        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>I always have a few projects that I'm working on, whether it's a plugin for my text editor, a better way of testing software, or school assignments. I'm currently interested in build systems, dependency tracking, and fundamental algorithms.</p>
        <p>I know plenty of languages, but I keep coming back to C. I write in C++ when it's required for classes, but for object-oriented programming on top of C, I much prefer Objective-C. I've recently been playing with Go, as well. Beyond all of this, I like seeing how languages get work done, from the loaders to runtime support and standard libraries.</p>
        <p>If an interpreted language fits the problem better, then I'll reach for Python or JavaScript. On occasion, I'll use Ruby, Vimscript, or AppleScript, if I absolutely have to. I started playing around with R for a statistics class, too.</p>
